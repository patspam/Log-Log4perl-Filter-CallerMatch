Log-Log4perl-Filter-CallerMatch

This is a Log4perl custom filter that allows for filtering against package and subroutine (as returned by caller()), 
as well as log message contents. The call frame to be tested against can be specified explicitly or an integer range 
can be given. This filter has proved to be useful in WebGUI development where the Log4perl category is used to 
represent site names, thus you need another way of filtering log messages from the area of code you're interested in.
